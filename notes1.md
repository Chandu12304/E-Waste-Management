## 1. **Problem Statement**

**Electronic waste (e-waste)** is one of the fastest-growing waste streams globally. Discarded electronics like phones, computers, and appliances contain hazardous materials that can harm the environment and human health if not disposed of properly.  
**Key challenges:**
- Lack of awareness about proper e-waste disposal.
- Inconvenient or inaccessible collection centers.
- Informal recycling leading to pollution and health risks.
- Limited incentives for users to recycle electronics.

## 2. **Real-World Issues**

- **Environmental Impact:** Toxic substances (lead, mercury, cadmium) leach into soil and water, causing pollution.
- **Health Hazards:** Informal recycling exposes workers to dangerous chemicals.
- **Resource Loss:** Valuable materials (gold, copper) are lost instead of being recovered.
- **Regulatory Gaps:** Many regions lack effective e-waste management policies or enforcement.

## 3. **How Your Project Solves the Problem**

Your project provides a **digital platform** that connects users, collection centers, recycling facilities, and e-waste shops.  
**Key solutions:**
- **Centralized Information:** Users can find nearby collection centers and recycling facilities.
- **User Engagement:** Features like contribution tracking and user profiles encourage responsible disposal.
- **Admin Tools:** Admins can manage centers, facilities, and shop inventory.
- **E-Shop:** Promotes the reuse of refurbished electronics, reducing waste.
- **Awareness:** Informational sections (About Us, Impact) educate users on e-waste issues.

## 5. **Tech Stack and Functionalities (In Depth)**

### **Frontend (React)**
- **React.js:** Component-based UI for a dynamic, responsive user experience.
- **CSS Modules:** Scoped styling for each component (e.g., `AboutUs.css`, `Profile.css`).
- **Vite:** Fast development server and build tool.
- **Component Structure:** Modular, with folders for each feature (e.g., `Profile`, `E_Shop`, `Admin`).
- **API Integration:** Uses `fetch` or `axios` to communicate with the backend.

### **Backend (Node.js + Express)**
- **Express.js:** Handles HTTP requests, routing, and middleware.
- **Body-Parser & CORS:** Middleware for parsing requests and handling cross-origin resource sharing.
- **Route Organization:** Separate files for each resource (users, auth, collection centers, etc.), with admin and user routes.
- **Environment Variables:** Uses `dotenv` for secure configuration.

### **Database (Supabase/PostgreSQL)**
- **Supabase:** Provides a hosted PostgreSQL database with RESTful and real-time APIs.
- **Tables:** Users, Admins, Collection Centers, Recycling Facilities, E-Waste Items, Shop Inventory.
- **CRUD Operations:** Handled via Supabase client in backend routes.
- **Authentication:** User and admin credentials stored securely, with JWT for session management.

### **DevOps & Hosting**
- **Render:** Hosts the backend server, auto-redeploys on code changes.
- **Vercel:** (Assumed) Hosts the frontend for fast, global delivery.
- **GitHub Actions:** Workflow to keep the backend awake and automate tasks.

## 6. **Database Management**

- **Supabase as a Service:**  
  - **Tables:**  
    - `users`: Stores user info, credentials, contribution stats.
    - `admins`: Admin credentials and roles.
    - `collection_centers`: Details of all e-waste drop-off points.
    - `recycling_facilities`: Info about recycling partners.
    - `ewaste_items`: Track items collected, processed, or sold.
    - `shop_inventory`: Products available in the e-shop.
  - **Security:**  
    - Uses environment variables for DB credentials.
    - JWT for user/admin authentication.
  - **Queries:**  
    - CRUD operations for all resources.
    - Role-based access for admin/user actions.
    - Data validation and error handling in backend routes.
